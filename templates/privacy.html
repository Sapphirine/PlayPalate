We collect your music listening data from any app that's synced with Facebook. 

Music apps that can be synced with Facebook include Spotify, Rdio, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and maybe we'll get to Shazam. 

We'll use this data to profile your taste in music, ultimately to create playlists for you in Spotify. 

This is a project for class. We promise not to do anything creepy with your data.
